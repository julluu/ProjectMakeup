# MakeupProject
Project inspired by my passion: makeup

This is a database for my makeup. It's purpose is to track the usage percentage of my eyeshadow palettes and organize them in the desired order.

Pan = one individual shade on the palette

Pan hit = shade, that has been used so much that you can see the metal pan on the bottom of the shade

I want to add some things to this project in the future.
Things I'd like to add:
  * other products (lip products, blush, highlighters etc)
  * categorization by colourstories of the palettes
  * counter for how many products I have from each brand
  * random makeup picker
